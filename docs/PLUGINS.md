# Plug-ins Architecture

updated: 2020.05.26

## Overview

## Security

Security will be permission based.  Plug-ins will request permissions and boot noode will grant permissions.
Current thinking is the boot node will get permissions from a configuration file.  It will share those with
child nodes as needed.

## Behaviors
There are a couple of permitted behaviors that are defined by the interfaces.  Current thinking is
there are 2:  ledger and API.
