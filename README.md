# Iron Bar

Iron is synonym for chain and bar is a synonym for block.  This project
is to develop an [SSI system](https://sovrin.org/faq/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/) using block chain that can be used in various scenerios
like games.

It's not limited to games, just an example.

### Architectural Goals
1. Server components can run on any OS
2. Secure using latest encryption standards
3. Client connectivity from any operating system
4. New use cases can be added by plug-in pattern
5. Simple to understand both in nomenclature and implementation

# Status
Prototype/irregular updates

### 2024.03.30 Update
Reopening this project to add CI/CD deployment to AWS or Azure.

This project is being updated with new functionality on an irregular basis.  Please review [work.md](https://github.com/tatmanblue/ironbar/blob/master/docs/WORK.md) 
for details on goals and progress towards those goals.  There is no regular release schedule in place.  Work is completed on an adhoc schedule.

# Source Code Structure/Projects

### Nodes
Nodes are center piece of `Iron Bar`.  They handle all of the block chain transactions.

One running node will be sufficient to use `Iron Bar`, but that is not recommended.  At this time, it has not 
been determined which configuration is optimal.  The goal is several nodes working together with one node
as the controller or boot node and the others functioning as creating block nodes and validation nodes.

The bootnode is responsible for delegating work to additional nodes as well as acting as the public endpoint to apps consuming `Iron Bar`.

The remaining nodes will be responsible for blockchain management:  creating new chains, validating 
(ak proofs), and distributed storage of chains (distributed block chain ledger).

When a new block is created, the bootnode will randomly assign creation to 3+ nodes and randomly assign
validation to one or more nodes.   

When there is only 1 node, the bootnode handles it all and there is no distributed block chain ledger.

### Gateway
For now, Gateway app is the web interface (web pages and restful API) to consuming Iron Bar.  

We would like to move the webapi into the bootnode if we can figure it out.  

### Credentials
The credentials project is an injectable service used by `nodes` to provide revokable credential services to `Iron Bar`.
It also serves as a one example to the community how to extend `Iron Bar` functionality.

### The plug-in architecture
Iron bar is designed to be extensible through plug-ins.  See the [plug-in doc](https://github.com/tatmanblue/ironbar/blob/master/docs/PLUGINS.md) for
more details.
